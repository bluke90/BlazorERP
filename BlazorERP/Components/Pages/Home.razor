                    This project is a personal showcase built by <b>Blake Ganzerla</b> to demonstrate full-stack development capabilities using modern .NET technologies.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The application is developed using <b>Blazor</b> and styled with <b>MudBlazor</b>, hosted on Azure, and backed by an SQL database — all configured with GitHub Actions for continuous deployment. It's structured to show off modular design, responsive UI, and real-world development practices.
                    <br/><br/>
                    From database scaffolding and automation integration to scalable API architecture and cloud deployment, this app reflects the same patterns and quality you'd find in a production ERP environment — just streamlined for demo purposes.

                    I'm <b>Blake Ganzerla</b>, a software developer with a strong background in C#, Blazor, .NET MAUI, and full-stack web application design. I hold a Bachelor's in Business Information Systems and am currently pursuing a Master's in Information Systems at Mississippi State University.
                    <br/><br/>
                    My professional experience includes building enterprise-grade tools for manufacturing, universities, and law firms — from backend APIs and automation systems to cloud-hosted web portals.
                    <br/><br/>
                    If you're a potential client or employer, this project serves as a live example of my work — clean, modular, cloud-deployed, and built with care.
